## Description
As a Full-Stack Web Developer, I have created an application that allows the user to search for a movie using an API key from OMDb. The user will then be able to 'nominate' movies for an award; once the user has reached 5 nominations, an alert will appear. All of the users nominations will be saved into local storage. The technologies used for this application was ReactJS, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, and ReactDOM.
